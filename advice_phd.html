<h2 id="transition-to-research">Transition to Research</h2>
<h3 id="preamble">Preamble</h3>
<p>Your transition from taking classes to doing research is abrupt. You have spent most of your life becoming very skilled at listening, reading, and repeating (taking tests). Now, you are told to create. Your dissertation is due in a few years and should be filled with new research.</p>
<p>Most humans react similarly to this situation. You feel daunted. You feel anxious, uncertain. You are not sure how to start. You assume nobody else feels this way and that everybody else knows what to do. Consequently, you do not ask for help.</p>
<p>Your feelings are perfectly normal and fine. It is daunting; you’re allowed to feel daunted, anxious, uncertain.</p>
<p>But, you should ask for help. Ask for help getting started with research from a professor. This does not mean you have to keep them as your advisor until you graduate; if it is not a good fit for whatever reason, the professor will be just as happy as you for you to find somebody else to be your advisor. Ask the professor for something to work on, to help you practice <em>doing</em> research (not just reading and learning about research).</p>
<p>If you have problems a professor can’t help with, then find somebody else who can help. A large percentage of PhD students struggle with anxiety and depression; if you’re among them, there are resources through Mizzou where you can ask for help, like the <a href="https://counseling.missouri.edu/">Counseling Center</a>.</p>
<h3 id="specific-suggestions">Specific Suggestions</h3>
<p>The following are synthesized from various sources and my own experience.</p>
<ol type="a">
<li>Create milestones for yourself. Don’t have a to-do list that just says “write dissertation.” Break down that big goal (dissertation) into smaller pieces, like each chapter. Then break down your first chapter into pieces. Keep breaking the pieces into smaller pieces until you have something specific you can accomplish <strong>today</strong>. Keep some medium-size pieces as “milestones” that you can celebrate. Passing your dissertation is an obvious proposal that is well worth celebrating, but hopefully you can find something to celebrate before then, too.</li>
<li>Structure your schedule, including times to relax. Without classes, you have a lot of flexibility. This is great: you can structure your own schedule to maximize your productivity. But if you don’t create an explicit structure, you might both feel very unproductive <em>and</em> feel like you’re working all the time. Figure out when your productivity is highest, medium, and lowest. Schedule your “difficult” research for your high-productivity times; e.g., if you’re at your best when you wake up, use that time to try to write proofs or write a difficult piece of code or make presentation slides (or whatever you find most difficult). If possible, schedule your TA work in lower-productivity times; it’s still important to do well, but (presumably) it requires less mental effort. In your lowest-productivity times, don’t try to work; try to relax and enjoy another activity that restores you.</li>
<li>Just keep doing research. At first, it won’t make sense; you have no perspective or deeper understanding or broad knowledge of the field. And you won’t think your work is good; and you may well be correct. But keep going. You will fail. You will fail many times. You will feel frustrated. But keep going. For research (and running marathons and most other serious endeavors), learning-by-doing cannot be replaced by simply reading and watching and listening. Eventually things will make sense; eventually your research will be good. (But you will always keep failing and keep feeling frustrated sometimes because that’s the nature of research; if you don’t want to keep failing, then you will be happier to start looking for another job now.)</li>
<li>Set up a regular (e.g., weekly) meeting with a professor (later your advisor) to ask for help. Most PhD students are bad at asking for help, so it’s good to make a commitment mechanism like this. (I once got “lost” for a couple very unproductive months without meeting with my advisor; this happened more frequently to my roommate who then ended up dropping out, so please learn from his experience and don’t skip meetings just because you have “nothing” to show your professor.) If you meet regularly with a professor (advisor), and you listen to their advice (and they are a decent advisor), then you will be able to graduate.</li>
<li>Take care of yourself. Take time to have fun, exercise, sleep, talk to a counselor if you’re feeling really depressed and/or stressed, etc. The PhD program is an investment in your human capital, so it would be counter-productive to let it depreciate for any reason.</li>

<p>My advice is in <a href="https://drive.google.com/file/d/1QtZNe7xtxpIsZxexEiwGzWg4B1czaAMj/view?usp=sharing">Chapter 1 here</a></p>
<p>I also like <a href="https://drive.google.com/file/d/19S5BJFUY0JIMW4SQloKRVy6iMiIN7xXS/view?usp=sharing">John Cochrane’s writing and presentation advice</a></p>

<p>Some of the writing advice in <a href="https://drive.google.com/file/d/1QtZNe7xtxpIsZxexEiwGzWg4B1czaAMj/view?usp=sharing">Chapter 1 here</a> also applies to presenting: thinking about structure, simplicity, transitions, etc.</p>

<h3 id="shawns-suggestions">Shawn’s Suggestions</h3>
<p>These suggestions are courtesy of <a href="https://economics.missouri.edu/people/ni">Shawn Ni</a>. He has advised countless PhD students at Mizzou and led the PhD Research Workshop for many years. I added some related details.</p>
<ul>
<li>Do not simply read your slides.
<ul>
<li>To help avoid this (and for other reasons): do not write in full sentences on slides.</li>
<li>Plan beforehand what to say for each slide; you can even write out what you plan to say in full sentences (and even bring these as notes in case you forget), but do not put the full sentences on the slides.</li>
</ul></li>
<li>Ensure everything on each slide is visible/legible. E.g., don’t copy a huge results table and scale it down to 10% where each number is only 6 pixels tall.
<ul>
<li>Don’t use more than two levels within bullet point lists (like this). Not only does this help visibility, but it also alerts you to a poor structure. If you think you need a third level, either a) you are including too much detail for a talk or b) you need to split the slide into multiple slides.</li>
</ul></li>
<li>Practice
<ul>
<li>Including timing: I suggest recording how long each slide takes (rounded to the nearest half minute, say), and then thinking how you want to change the timing. E.g., you may realize a single slide is taking 5 minutes even though the topic is not primary. You can either try to write down times as you practice, or just record yourself (e.g., in Zoom) and then watch the recorded video to see time stamps.</li>
</ul></li>
<li>Practice…</li>
<li>Practice!</li>
