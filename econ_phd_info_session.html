<h2 id="overview">Goals</h2>
<p>Info session goals: help you...
<ul>
  <li>decide if an Economics PhD would best help you achieve your life goals (vs. Economics MA, or non-Economics grad school, or get a job), thinking both about the "investment" (in your skills and knowledge, which opens certain career paths) and "consumption" (your enjoyment [or not!] of the five more years as a student)</li>
  <li>prepare for an Economics PhD while still an undergraduate</li>
  <li>prepare application materials</li>
  <li>decide where to apply/attend</li>
</ul></p>

<!-- <p>Abbreviations
  <ul>
    <li>GRE: XXX</li>
  </ul>
  </p> -->

  <h2 id="fit">Fit: is an Economics PhD right for you?</h2>
  Baseline/reference point: you get a job and start working (instead of grad school); how does PhD compare?
  Primary differences are in the dimensions of "investment" (you gain the "benefit" of particular skills/knowledge for the "opportunity cost" of making/saving less money as a student) and "consumption" (your lifestyle as a student differs from a full-time worker).
  <h3 id="fit-I">Investment</h3>
  <p>Having an Economics PhD opens certain career opportunities that may otherwise be unavailable (or much less available).
     However, if you'd be just as happy in another career, then it may not be worth getting a PhD.</p>
  <p>The single best source for learning about Economics PhD-level jobs is the <a href="https://www.aeaweb.org/joe/listings">Job Openings for Economists (JOE)</a> from the <a href="https://www.aeaweb.org/">American Economic Association (AEA)</a>, specifically the August&ndash;January postings.
     Many are "academic" jobs (i.e., professor) that require a PhD; within these, some are a mix of research and teaching, while others are almost entirely teaching.
     You can find (Google) salary data for faculty from most public universities.
     Of course, there are considerations besides salary, too, like flexibility and autonomy.
     There are also many jobs spanning private, public, and non-profit sectors.
  </p>
  <p>If you are a U.S. citizen, then there are also many nice Economics PhD-level jobs with the federal government, which you can browse on <a href="https://www.usajobs.gov/">USA Jobs</a>.
     These include the obvious "economics" departments like the Bureau of Labor Statistics or the Congressional Budget Office as well as less obvious ones like the Army Corps of Engineers and the Federal Communications Commission (where one Mizzou Econ PhD alum got a job).
     Almost everyone values the insights of an economist now.
     That said, many economics listings on USA Jobs do not require a PhD, so you should still consider the tradeoffs between applying to jobs now versus applying to PhD programs.
  </p>
  

  <h3 id="fit-C">Consumption</h3>
  <p>Besides your longer-term future, your shorter-term (five years) future is also affected by choosing a PhD program versus working.
     If you really enjoy learning and research, and you are not in a rush to "settle down," then you may enjoy being a PhD student more than working full-time.
     If you do not enjoy research, or you prefer to have a higher salary immediately, or you want to get settled into a "permanent" adult life/job/location, then you may prefer to start working full-time.
     Completing a PhD takes five years, after which you will very likely move to a different city (unless you want to stay in the same city by sacrificing the job opportunities that you started a PhD to get in the first place!).
  </p>

  <h3 id="fit-fail">What if I start a PhD but fail to graduate?</h3>
  <p>Most PhD programs allow you to earn a master's degree at some point, so even if you don't finish your dissertation to get a PhD, you still have an MA.
     Some programs like ours will let you stay (with funding) an extra semester after failing qualifying exams (end of Year 1) to get an MA, although I am not sure how common that is.
  </p>

  <h2>How to prepare as an undergraduate</h2>
  <p>Looking at our <a href="https://economics.missouri.edu/grad/apply#phd">required items for PhD application</a> provides some hints about how to prepare as an undergraduate.
    <ul>
      <li>Economics courses including intermediate micro and macro and ideally econometrics (but note you do not need to major in economics; I was a computer science major myself and actually in college did not take econometrics, which is now my specialization)</li>
      <li>Math courses including multivariable calculus, linear algebra (matrix theory), and probability/statistics, and optionally additional courses like differential equations or discrete math or real analysis.</li>
      <li>Research of some sort (not necessarily in economics or even "academic" research): maybe a term paper for a class, or an honors thesis, or a volunteer research assistant for a professor, or a job that involved research-like activity.
          This is partly to make sure you know your own preferences about doing research, so that you make a well-informed decision; and also gives you something to write about in your personal statement, and ideally you had some sort of supervisor who can write a letter of recommendation.</li>
      <li>Take the GRE "early" if you can, so if you don't do well, then you can just take it again; admissions committees will generally only (or primarily) look at your most recent score</li>
    </ul>
  </p>
  
  <h2>Preparing application materials</h2>
  <p>If you have prepared as above, it is relatively straightforward to prepare your application materials, which are basically the same for every school you apply to (except you can change one paragraph in your personal statement).
     Our advice for letters of recommendation is on <a href="https://economics.missouri.edu/grad/apply#phd">our website</a>: "Most helpful from a supervisor/advisor of your research, or your supervisor/boss at a job; we can already see your transcript, so letters from course instructors are usually not insightful."
     Our advice for your personal statement is at the same link, too.
     Besides that, you just need to submit your transcripts, GRE scores, and a CV/resume.
     (International students may also need to take the TOEFL.)
  </p>
  
  <h2 id="compare">Comparing programs</h2>
  <p>There are a few main ways to compare programs, besides their geographic location (which affects the consumption value, though not the investment value).
     XXX PROGRAM STRUCTURE PRETTY SIMILAR ACROSS US PROGRAMS...
