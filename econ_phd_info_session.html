<h1 class="title">Economics PhD Info Session Notes</h1>

<h2 id="overview">Goals</h2>
<p>Info session goals: help you...
<ul>
  <li>decide if an Economics PhD would best help you achieve your life goals (vs. Economics MA, or non-Economics grad school, or get a job), thinking both about the "investment" (in your skills and knowledge, which opens certain career paths) and "consumption" (your enjoyment [or not!] of the five more years as a student)</li>
  <li>prepare for an Economics PhD while still an undergraduate</li>
  <li>prepare application materials</li>
  <li>decide where to apply/attend</li>
</ul></p>

  <h2 id="fit">Fit: is an Economics PhD right for you?</h2>
  <p>
    Economics research: using quantitative skills to answer social science and/or policy questions.
    For example, current <a href="https://economics.missouri.edu/grad/published-research">Mizzou faculty research</a> includes topics like the criminal justice system, (in)stability of the banking system, ride-sharing, estimating causal effects from observational data, abortion, climate change, health care, marijuana laws, software as a service (SaaS), and pension reform, among many other topics.
  </p>
  <p>Baseline/reference point: you get a job and start working (instead of grad school); how does Economics PhD compare?
     Primary differences are in the dimensions of "investment" (you gain the "benefit" of particular skills/knowledge for the "opportunity cost" of making/saving less money as a student) and "consumption" (your lifestyle as a student differs from a full-time worker).
  </p>
  <h3 id="fit-I">Investment</h3>
  <p>Job type/location: having an Economics PhD opens certain career opportunities that may otherwise be unavailable (or much less available).
     However, if you'd be just as happy in another career, then it may not be worth getting a PhD.
     Further, if you really care about having a particular PhD-level <em>type</em> of job, then you may have little choice about <em>where</em> you live.
     For example, I really wanted to be a professor at a research university (in the U.S.); I applied for all such jobs (80+) and ultimately had two job offers, both in the midwest.
     On the other hand, my family has really enjoyed living here (despite my partner's and my initial bias against anywhere outside California), so I may have made the wrong choice for me (i.e., not get a PhD) if I had been told I'd only have job offers in the midwest.
     Nonetheless, the job type/location tension is real for PhD students, which many U.S. students do not realize.
  </p>
  <p>The single best source for learning about Economics PhD-level jobs is the <a href="https://www.aeaweb.org/joe/listings">Job Openings for Economists (JOE)</a> from the <a href="https://www.aeaweb.org/">American Economic Association (AEA)</a>, specifically the August&ndash;January postings.
     Many are "academic" jobs (i.e., professor) that require a PhD; within these, some are a mix of research and teaching, while others are almost entirely teaching.
     You can find (Google) salary data for faculty from most public universities.
     Of course, there are considerations besides salary, too, like flexibility and autonomy.
     There are also many jobs spanning private, public, and non-profit sectors.
  </p>
  <p>If you are a U.S. citizen, then there are also many nice Economics PhD-level jobs with the federal government, which you can browse on <a href="https://www.usajobs.gov/">USA Jobs</a>.
     These include the obvious "economics" departments like the Bureau of Labor Statistics or the Congressional Budget Office as well as less obvious ones like the Army Corps of Engineers and the Federal Communications Commission (where one Mizzou Econ PhD alum got a job).
     Almost everyone values the insights of an economist now.
     That said, many economics listings on USA Jobs do not require a PhD, so you should still consider the tradeoffs between applying to jobs now versus applying to PhD programs.
  </p>
  

  <h3 id="fit-C">Consumption</h3>
  <p>Besides your longer-term future, your shorter-term (five years) future is also affected by choosing a PhD program versus working.
     If you really enjoy learning and research, and you are not in a rush to "settle down," then you may enjoy being a PhD student more than working full-time.
     If you do not enjoy research, or you prefer to have a higher salary immediately, or you want to get settled into a "permanent" adult life/job/location, then you may prefer to start working full-time.
     Completing a PhD takes five years, after which you will very likely move to a different city (unless you want to stay in the same city by sacrificing the job opportunities that you started a PhD to get in the first place!).
     Doing research as an undergrad not only helps you get into better programs, but it helps you learn about your preferences/enjoyment of research, which helps you make a good decision about whether or not to pursue a PhD.
  </p>
  <p>
    It's possible for you to be a parent and complete your PhD, but it does add a challenge that most others do not face.
    On the flip side, if you manage to graduate and get an academic job (as a professor), then you may appreciate the flexibility to spend more waking hours with your kids (pick them up from school, etc.), as I greatly appreciate myself.
    And being a parent is challenging regardless; it's arguably not any easier to become a parent while working full-time.
  </p>

  <h3 id="fit-fail">What if I start a PhD but fail to graduate?</h3>
  <p>Most PhD programs allow you to earn a master's degree at some point, so even if you don't finish your dissertation to get a PhD, you still have an MA.
     Some programs like ours will let you stay (with funding) an extra semester after failing qualifying exams (end of Year 1) to get an MA, although I am not sure how common that is.
  </p>

  <h2>How to prepare as an undergraduate</h2>
  <p>Looking at our <a href="https://economics.missouri.edu/grad/apply#phd">required items for PhD application</a> provides some hints about how to prepare as an undergraduate.
    <ul>
      <li>Economics courses including intermediate micro and macro and ideally econometrics (but note you do not need to major in economics; I was a computer science major myself and actually in college did not take econometrics, which is now my specialization)</li>
      <li>Math courses including multivariable calculus, linear algebra (matrix theory), and probability/statistics, and optionally additional courses like differential equations or discrete math or real analysis.</li>
      <li>Research of some sort (not necessarily in economics or even "academic" research): maybe a term paper for a class, or an honors thesis, or a volunteer research assistant for a professor, or a job that involved research-like activity.
          This is partly to make sure you know your own preferences about doing research, so that you make a well-informed decision; and also gives you something to write about in your personal statement, and ideally you had some sort of supervisor who can write a letter of recommendation.</li>
      <li>Take the GRE "early" if you can, so if you don't do well, then you can just take it again; admissions committees will generally only (or primarily) look at your most recent score</li>
    </ul>
  </p>
  
  <h2>Preparing application materials</h2>
  <p>If you have prepared as above, it is relatively straightforward to prepare your application materials, which are basically the same for every school you apply to (except you can change one paragraph in your personal statement).
     Our advice for letters of recommendation is on <a href="https://economics.missouri.edu/grad/apply#phd">our website</a>: "Most helpful from a supervisor/advisor of your research, or your supervisor/boss at a job; we can already see your transcript, so letters from course instructors are usually not insightful."
     Our advice for your personal statement is at the same link, too.
     Besides that, you just need to submit your transcripts, GRE scores, and a CV/resume.
     (International students may also need to take the TOEFL.)
  </p>
  
  <h2 id="compare">Comparing programs</h2>
  <p>There are a few main ways to compare programs, besides their geographic location (which affects the consumption value, though not the investment value).
     The program structure is very similar across U.S. Economics PhD programs, so that is generally not a differentiating factor: you take the "core" courses in Year 1, take electives in Year 2, start some sort of research paper in Year 2/3, then work on your dissertation the rest of the time and try to graduate in five years.
    <ul>
      <li>Research: it's not perfect, but the <a href="https://ideas.repec.org/top/top.usecondept.html">RePEc research ranking</a> gives you an approximate sense of how programs compare in terms of faculty research, which is a necessary but not sufficient condition for them being able to train you well to do research.
          (Put differently: if they can't do high-quality research themselves, then they can't teach you how to; but just because they can do research doesn't necessarily mean that they can teach effectively, too.)
          Of course, you should apply to a range of school ranks (apply high in case you get lucky, apply low in case you don't), but the RePEc ranking can help give you a sanity check.
          Another important element of "research" is whether faculty actually coauthor research with PhD students.
          Our <a href="https://economics.missouri.edu/grad/published-research">department research page</a> shows PhD student authors by indicating their year of PhD graduation.</li>
      <li>Funding: <a href="https://economics.missouri.edu/grad/phd">our PhD program page</a> describes our financial support as an example.
          Check the "stipend" (salary) amount, whether you get a "tuition waiver" (i.e., you do not need to pay tuition, so only taxes are taken out of your stipend paycheck; this is common), what type of work is required (teaching assistant or research assistant is most common), and any other benefits like health insurance, as well as how many years of funding are typically provided.</li>
      <li>Job placement: you should check where recent graduates (say past 5&ndash;10 years) of each program got jobs, like we provide on <a href="https://economics.missouri.edu/grad/phd-student-placement-history">our job placement history page</a>.
          At least some of the jobs should sound appealing to you, otherwise it may not be worth your spending five years in that program.
          Beware, though: higher-ranked programs have better placements partly because they can admit better students; if you would be a below-average student at School A or a top student at School B, then it would be misleading to compare the top job placements from School B with the top placements from School A.</li>
    </ul>
