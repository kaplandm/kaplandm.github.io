<h2 id="overview">Goals</h2>
<p>Info session goals: help you...
<ul>
  <li>decide if an Economics PhD would best help you achieve your life goals (vs. Economics MA, or non-Economics grad school, or get a job), thinking both about the "investment" (in your skills and knowledge, which opens certain career paths) and "consumption" (your enjoyment [or not!] of the five more years as a student)</li>
  <li>prepare for an Economics PhD while still an undergraduate</li>
  <li>prepare application materials</li>
  <li>decide where to apply/attend</li>
</ul></p>

<!-- <p>Abbreviations

  <h2 id="fit">Fit: is an Economics PhD right for you?</h2>
  Baseline/reference point: you get a job and start working (instead of grad school); how does PhD compare?
  Primary differences are in the dimensions of "investment" (you gain the "benefit" of particular skills/knowledge for the "opportunity cost" of making/saving less money as a student) and "consumption" (your lifestyle as a student differs from a full-time worker).
  <h3 id="fit-I">Investment</h3>
  <p>Having an Economics PhD opens certain career opportunities that may otherwise be unavailable (or much less available).
     However, if you'd be just as happy in another career, then it may not be worth getting a PhD.</p>
  <p>The single best source for learning about Economics PhD-level jobs is the <a href="https://www.aeaweb.org/joe/listings">Job Openings for Economists (JOE)</a> from the <a href="https://www.aeaweb.org/">American Economic Association (AEA)</a>, specifically the August&ndash;January postings.
     XXX SUMMARIZE

  <p>If you are a U.S. citizen, then there are also many nice Economics PhD-level jobs with the federal government, which you can browse on <a href="https://www.usajobs.gov/">USA Jobs</a>.
