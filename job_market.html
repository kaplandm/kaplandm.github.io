<h2 id="overview">Overview</h2>
<p>During Year 5, you will be on the job market.
Most of your time will be spent preparing and submitting applications, practicing for interviews, and doing interviews, besides related tasks like travel logistics.
This means you will not have much time for research, besides maybe wrapping up your third chapter in March.</p>


<p>We (faculty/dept) want to help you succeed:
<ul>
  <li>your committee members will write recommendation letters (after you ask them nicely) and help you revise your job market paper; </li>
  <li>we can do mock (practice) interviews with you; </li>
  <li>we have <a href="https://www.overleaf.com/read/gtfzpkwrzhhw">LaTeX templates/examples</a>; </li>
  <li>we can give you feedback on a practice job talk; </li>
  <li>we have some funding for travel to first-round AEA/ASSA interviews; </li>
</ul>
and for whatever else you need, we will do our best to help.</p>
  
<p>Statements below about the Director of Doctoral Studies (DDS) may change if I am no longer DDS.</p>
  
<p>Abbreviations
  <ul>
    <li>DDS: Director of Doctoral Studies</li>
    <li>JM: job market</li>
    <li>JMC: job market candidate (you!)</li>
    <li>JMP: job market paper</li>
    <li>AEA/ASSA/annual meeting: there is a big joint conference every year at the beginning of January that combines the American Economic Association (AEA) and Allied Social Sciences Association (ASSA), as well as Econometric Society (ES) and others; besides being a conference with talks and panels and such, first-round job interviews typically occur on the same days in the same hotels.</li>
    <li>JOE: <a href="https://www.aeaweb.org/joe/listings">Job Openings for Economists</a></li>
    <li>EJM: <a href="https://econjobmarket.org">EconJobMarket</a></li>
  </ul>
  </p>

<h2 id="schedule">Schedule</h2>
  <p>The schedule is roughly as follows.</p>

<p>September or earlier: you (the job market candidate, JMC) should have your best research paper complete and "polished" (no spelling or grammar errors, etc.); this is your "job market paper" (JMP).</p>
  
<p>End of September: you can start a spreadsheet to keep track of relevant job openings on the AEA <a href="https://www.aeaweb.org/joe/listings">Job Openings for Economists (JOE)</a> and <a href="https://econjobmarket.org">EconJobMarket (EJM)</a>, which contain essentially all the academic jobs (plus many others).</p>

<p>September and October: you make a CV, research statement, teaching statement, and anything else requested by jobs you're applying to (see LaTeX templates/examples below); again, examples and templates are available.
  You should also ask your committee members to write recommendation letters.</p>
  
<p>October/November: job applications are due; you can create and practice your job talk (ask DDS about practice opportunities, or directly ask 9413 workshop coordinator or brown bag seminar coordinator).</p>
  
<p>November/December: you can do practice interviews (can ask DDS to arrange).</p>
  
<p>Mid-December: first-round interviews for the European job market (if you're interested).</p>

<p>Early January: first-round interviews at the AEA/ASSA conference, although some schools try to interview earlier to gain a strategic advantage.</p>

<p>Then, besides more practice and trying to learn about your potential new colleagues and employers, just hope for the best!</p>


  <h2 id="health">Mental Health</h2>
<p>The job market is an emotional and stressful (and long) process.
Mizzou offers <a href="https://counseling.missouri.edu">many free resources</a> to deal with the mental health effects, and you are also welcome to talk with the DDS for other ideas.
Also, remember that even for successful candidates, most applications do not become interviews, and most first-round interviews do not become flyouts; you just need one job offer to have great success.
