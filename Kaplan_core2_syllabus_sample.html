PDF version is available on my website, <a href="#fn1"
class="footnote-ref" id="fnref1" role="doc-noteref"><sup>1</sup></a> and
I will provide you with a hard copy printed by Mizzou Publishing within
the first few weeks of the semester.</p>
<p><strong>Software</strong> Stata can be used in the on-campus computer

Anywhere</a>, just make sure to save your work (to your own computer or
email) frequently to avoid losing progress.</p>
<p><strong>Course Website</strong> There will be a Canvas course website
(<a href="https://canvas.umsystem.edu/"
class="uri">https://canvas.umsystem.edu/</a>). I&#x2019;ll mostly just post
announcements (if necessary) and assignments. Make sure your settings
are such that you get emailed when a new announcement (etc.)&#xA0;is posted.
If you cannot access the Canvas site, please let me know ASAP.</p>
<h1 data-number="2" id="learning-objectives"><span
class="header-section-number">2</span> Learning objectives</h1>
<p>By the end of the course, you&#x2019;ll be able to do the following.</p>
<ul>
<li><p><span id="TLO:terms" label="TLO:terms"></span> Define terms and
concepts, both mathematically and intuitively.</p></li>
<li><p><span id="TLO:intuition" label="TLO:intuition"></span> Develop
intuition for fundamental concepts to enable you to understand
econometrics papers/books that you need to read later for your own
research.</p></li>
<li><p><span id="TLO:methods" label="TLO:methods"></span> Describe
various econometric methods both mathematically and intuitively,
including their objects of interest and assumptions, and the logical
relationship between the assumptions and corresponding theorems and
properties.</p></li>
<li><p><span id="TLO:significance" label="TLO:significance"></span> For
a given economic question, dataset, and econometric method, judge
whether the method is appropriate and assess the economic significance
and statistical significance of the results.</p></li>
<li><p><span id="TLO:Stata" label="TLO:Stata"></span> Use Stata to
manipulate and analyze data, interpreting results both economically and
statistically.</p></li>
</ul>
<h1 data-number="3" id="classes"><span
class="header-section-number">3</span> Classes</h1>
<p>Generally, each class follows the same structure.</p>
<ol type="1">
<li><p>First, you may ask any questions about the textbook material
(including, &#x201C;Could you please explain the part about ___?&#x201D;).</p></li>
<li><p>Second, I will alternate presenting material / lecturing with
Discussion Questions (DQs). You first discuss the DQ with somebody
sitting near you; then you share your (or your partner&#x2019;s!)&#xA0;ideas with
the full class.</p></li>
<li><p>Third, there is usually (hopefully?)&#xA0;time to ask additional
questions at the end.</p></li>
</ol>
<p>Before each class, I expect you to prepare enough to participate in
class. For some of you, it may be sufficient to simply show up and
listen carefully, without any pre-class preparation. For others, you may
find you need to peek ahead in the textbook to understand enough to
participate in the DQs, or even to realize what you don&#x2019;t understand
enough to ask a question about it.</p>

<p>Participation is graded by effort. Whether you say something &#x201C;right&#x201D;
or &#x201C;smart&#x201D; is irrelevant. In fact, this is a good opportunity to get
comfortable with being wrong and feeling dumb, which will aid your later
transition from classwork to research. (I do expect that after a few
years of research you&#x2019;ll be an expert on your dissertation topic, but I
have no such expectations now.) If you make a &#x201C;good faith&#x201D; (sincere)
effort to participate in every class meeting, then you&#x2019;ll get 100% for
this component of your grade. This includes both asking questions at the
beginning of class and participating in the Discussion Questions. If you
are always confused and never have &#x201C;answers&#x201D; but ask your very basic
questions, that counts just as fully as if you&#x2019;re never confused and
never have questions but always respond to the in-class discussion
questions.</p>
<p>On exams, you will be allowed to use the textbook, your notes, and
any other printed materials, but you may not have any electronics
(laptop, phone, etc.). You may discuss exercise sets with your
classmates, but you must turn in your own work. As in research, always
cite your sources, whether the textbook, a classmate, something online,
etc.; see the Academic Integrity section below.</p>
<p>Letter grades will be mapped in the usual way, i.e., A range is
90&#x2013;100%, B range 80&#x2013;89.99%, C 70&#x2013;79.99%, F below that. Any &#x201C;curve,&#x201D; if
it seems appropriate, will <em>not</em> enforce predetermined grade
<em>proportions</em> but rather move everyone up together; that is, you
are not competing with the student next to you for a fixed number of A
grades.</p>
<h1 data-number="6" id="penalties-for-late-work"><span
class="header-section-number">6</span> Penalties for Late Work</h1>
<p>Assignments turned in late but before the beginning of the next class
will receive half the points earned. After the beginning of the next
class, no credit will be given, though I am happy to still give feedback
on the work if you turn it in (to help you learn).</p>
<p>You are expected to take the exams at the scheduled times. In case of
an emergency such as serious injury/illness, you must contact me
immediately (i.e., before the exam) to request a makeup. (It doesn&#x2019;t
matter whether or not I read your email before the exam, just that you
sent it before.) If you miss (and don&#x2019;t make up) the midterm or final,
then you will receive an &#x201C;incomplete&#x201D; for your semester grade.</p>
<h1 data-number="7" id="grading-questions"><span
class="header-section-number">7</span> Grading Questions</h1>
<p>Graded work will be returned toward the end of class. You will have
the rest of class time to review the comments and ask questions. If you
think something in the scoring is amiss (points added incorrectly, logic
misunderstood, etc.), then just let me know and leave the work with me
to review. If it is a non-trivial question, I may review the work in its
entirety and adjust other parts up or down if there are other
inconsistencies with the grading rubric. Otherwise, after leaving the
classroom with your work, you may still ask me questions about it, but
the recorded grade will not be changed.</p>
<h1 data-number="8" id="academic-integrity"><span
class="header-section-number">8</span> Academic Integrity</h1>
<p>As will be the case after you graduate, collaboration and use of
whatever books/papers/tutorials you can find will be generally permitted
in this class, except as noted for exams. However, as will be the case
after you graduate, integrity is still important. If you use something,
cite it, whether a paper, book, person, or URL. If you collaborate with
other students, note this at the top of your ES. If you&#x2019;re not sure
whether to cite something, err on the side of including too many
citations.</p>
<p>Below are more formal statements about academic integrity, which you
may have already read on another syllabus.</p>
<p>Academic integrity is fundamental to the activities and principles of
a university. All members of the academic community must be confident
that each person&#x2019;s work has been responsibly and honorably acquired,
developed, and presented. Any effort to gain an advantage not given to
all students is dishonest whether or not the effort is successful. The
academic community regards breaches of the academic integrity rules as
extremely serious matters.</p>
<p>Link: <a href="https://oai.missouri.edu/students/">Standard of
Conduct for Academic Integrity</a></p>
<p>In addition, you are expected to adhere to the following honor pledge
on all graded work, whether or not explicitly asked in advance to do so:
&#x201C;I strive to uphold the University values of respect, responsibility,
discovery, and excellence. On my honor, I pledge that I have neither
given nor received unauthorized assistance on this work.&#x201D;</p>
<p>Further details on academic integrity are in Canvas: in &#x201C;Support
&amp; Policies,&#x201D; under &#x201C;MU Policies &amp; Expectations,&#x201D; please read
&#x201C;Academic Integrity.&#x201D;</p>
<h1 data-number="9" id="other-policies"><span
class="header-section-number">9</span> Other Policies</h1>
<p>These are mostly standard policies provided by the University; you
may have already seen the exact same statements on the syllabus for
other classes. That said, they are still helpful to be aware of.</p>
<h2 data-number="9.1" id="mental-health"><span

<p>Personal note: it is very common for Economics PhD students to have
depression and anxiety. <a href="#fn2" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref2"
role="doc-noteref"><sup>2</sup></a> For your long-term PhD success, it
is equally important to spend time working on your mental (and physical)
health as on your academic work. One perk of being a student is the
availability of many free/low-cost mental health resources (see
below).</p>
<p>The University of Missouri is committed to supporting student
well-being through an integrated network of care, with a wide range of

class="header-section-number">9.5</span> Executive Order No.&#xA0;38</h2>
<p>When you record something that happens in a course (a lecture, class
discussions, meetings, etc.), it has an impact on the rights of the
people captured in that recording. For example, your instructor and the
University may have rights to the intellectual property contained in
that recording. At the same time, another student who may have been
recorded has the right to privacy. In order to protect these rights, MU
employs a policy (called &#x201C;Executive Order No.&#xA0;38&#x201D;) to govern both
situations you may encounter while taking a course, i.e., when your
instructor does or does not allow recordings.</p>

<h2 data-number="9.8" id="statement-of-nondiscrimination"><span
class="header-section-number">9.8</span> Statement of
Nondiscrimination</h2>
<p>The University of Missouri does not discriminate on the basis of
race, color, religion, national origin, sex, sexual orientation, gender
identity, age, genetics information, disability, or status as a
protected veteran.</p>

encouraged (but not required) to report the incident to the MU Office of
Institutional Equity. Learn more about your rights and options at the <a
href="https://equity.missouri.edu/">Office of Institutional Equity</a>

<p>Note: (almost) all Mizzou employees are &#x201C;mandated reporters,&#x201D; meaning
that if you choose to write or speak with me about having experienced
any of these forms of prohibited discrimination or harassment, <a
href="https://equity.missouri.edu/reporting-and-policies/">Mizzou
policies require</a> that I share this information with the MU Office of
Institutional Equity. They will contact you to offer information about
resources, as well as your rights and options as a member of our campus
community.</p>
<h2 data-number="9.9" id="religious-holidays-accommodations"><span
class="header-section-number">9.9</span> Religious Holidays &amp;
Accommodations</h2>
<p>Many religious faiths are represented in the student body. The
University of Missouri does not restrict student free exercise of
religion, unless 1) the restriction is in the form of a rule of general
applicability, and does not discriminate against religion or among
religions; and 2) it can be demonstrated that the application of the
restriction is essential to furthering a compelling university interest,
and is not unduly restrictive considering the relevant circumstance. The
policy of the University attempts to strike a reasonable balance between
accommodating the religious practice of students and meeting academic
needs and standard. Consult IDE&#x2019;s Guide to Religions for the form that
can be used to notify an instructor of an absence associated with
religious practice. Students are expected to notify their instructor(s)
by completing and submitting this form in a manner that is consistent
with the procedure outlined in the university&#x2019;s policy on student
religious accommodation. Providing false information regarding sincerely
held religious practice is a violation of the university&#x2019;s Standard of
Conduct and will not be tolerated.</p>
