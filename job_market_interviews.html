<h2 id="overview">Questions (and Suggestions)</h2>
<p>
 <ul>
   <li>Tell me about your job market paper.  
       (Suggestion: Prepare multiple versions of your JMP summary, like 3-minute, 6-minute, 10-minute (or something), because you don't know when interviewers will first interrupt you and start asking questions. Some interviewers may simply listen until you seem done and stop talking; others may interrupt you very early. Because of this, you generally want to describe (briefly) your most important contributions first, then add secondary details if nobody has stopped you yet, then add tertiary details.)</li>
   <li>Do you believe the empirical results of your JMP?  
       (Suggestion: Say "yes" but then discuss the biggest threats to internal validity, as well as why ultimately you still believe your results.)</li>
   <li>Why do we care about your JMP's results?  
       (Suggestion: Besides giving some "intuitive" reasons, also refer to the literature if possible; even if they don't believe your intuition, they will trust it's a question people care about if there are top-5/well-cited published papers about the same topic/research question.)</li>
   <li>To which journal will you submit your JMP? 
       (Suggestion: Ask your advisor, and remember this isn't asking if it'll be accepted, just asking where you'll submit it, so aim high!  It's fine to say, "I know it's very difficult to get a paper accepted at QE, but I plan to submit there first.")</li>
   <li>What's your five-year plan for research?
       (Suggestion: First, if you have publications or working papers besides your JMP, mention all of those first; for example, "Besides publishing my JMP, I have another paper that's R&R at ___ that I hope to resubmit soon."
                    Second, if you can give the impression of a "research agenda" that connects your JMP with future work in progress, in terms of using the same techniques/models or being on the same topic or whatever similarity, that is helpful; like, "I plan to continue my research agenda on methods to address sample selection in nonlinear models, building on the work I've done for my job market paper. Specifically, I....")</li>
   <li>Where do you see research in the field of ____ going in the next 5-10 years? / What will be the most important research topics in your field in the next 5 years?
       (Suggestion: XXX.)</li>
